(1) The average education level in the sample is `r mean(wage1$educ)` years. The highest year of education is `r max(wage1$educ)` years. The lowest year of education is `r min(wage1$educ)` years.

(2) The average hourly wage in the sample is `r mean(wage1$wage)`. It seems low.

(3) CPI for year 1976 is 56.9; CPI for year 2023 is 304.7.

(4) The average hourly wage for year 2023 is `r mean(wage1$wage)*304.7/56.9`. It seems resonable.

(5) There are `r sum(wage1$female)` women in the sample. There are `r length(wage1$female) - sum(wage1$female)` men in the sample.
